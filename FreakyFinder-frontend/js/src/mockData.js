One time when I went there, they prepared a wonderful traditional buffet with tetelas, gordita de harina, café de olla in a clay pot, and more that you just can’t get anywhere else. It was just like my abuela used to make!',

She was so terrified, she ended up sitting on a boulder for an hour just to make sure it had gotten far enough away from her. She still won't go hiking alone anywhere.",

One of the lifeguards, Ms. Jen, really helped me get comfortable with holding my breath. She'd play this bobbing game with us that had a fun song to go along with it. Whenever I get in a pool, I still sing that song in my head.",

I dreaded going to the doctor, as I would always get a shot and foul-tasting medicine. After the tonsillectomy, I hardly ever got sick again. As a result, middle school was a lot better for me than elementary school.',
