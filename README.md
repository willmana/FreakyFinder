## Technical info

This application uses React + Node.js stack. It is connected to MongoDB document-oriented database and is hosted in free Fly.io server. 

To maintain some information in the frontend-side, the application utilizes redux with addition of redux-saga to help with action executions and redux store itself is written with [Ducks-pattern](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux).

Routing is done with react-router. Application first used useHistory() hook to direct users to different URLs but this was later changed to useNavigate() after react-router v6 update.

Application has localization support in Finnish and English, and can easily adapt more languages. This has been implemented with messageformat and messageformat-cli packages. Translations are maintained in .properties -files found in frontend/src/texts folder. Messageformat-cli provides a script that generates common .json -file from these .properties -files and messageformat allows the application to import these texts into its components.

Styling for the application is done from scratch utilizing sass -css extension without the help of any "ready made" components (e.g. react-bootstrap). Application supports browser width all the way from widescreen to around 700px, leaving out mobile device support.

Backend uses centralized express-jwt -implementation to handle JWT based authentication for API calls. JWT token is stored in browsers localStorage.
