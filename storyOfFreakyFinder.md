# Life of Freaky Finder

* ### 9.9.2021
```
Development was started. The plan is to complete the frontend side first before starting with the backend. First thing to do 
was to initialize React-application for our frontend. Lot of the time was spent with configuration and installing different 
tools that I was planning to use in the application. Also some research time was included of course. Before I started the 
development I wanted to think about the possible design, architecture and practices I will be using. After some sketching I 
initialized the landing page.

I knew that instead of including useStates in every file, I wanted to instead use redux store. So my goal was to setup very
solid 'redux foundation' for my application before it gets complicated. I configured basic redux and after that was done, I 
decided to make my life easier in the future and started to use redux-saga. This included lots of configuring by trial and
error, but the end result was very nicely configured store. I also decided to make my application support finnish and english
languages, so I installed and configured messageformat to enable this feature. Localization will be fully added later
